Object Detection using YOLOv5 

The outbreak of COTS i.e. Crown Of Thrones Starfish causes great harm to the coral reef of the surrounding region. One such scenario took place at Great Barrier Reef,
Australia. In order to protect the aquatic life from COTS which
eats up the faster growing corals and significantly damages the
reef and to make sure of the sustained development of Barrier
Reef, we should have a keen check over the population of ‘COTS’
in the entire region. Manual processes can be futile in marine life
over a large area. The problem can be solved by using Objection
Detection a key aspect of Computer Vision. Contributing to the
fact in such case we need more precision in terms of timely
detection than in terms of accuracy.
Referring to the current
state-of-art models for real time we tried implementing the novel
Yolov5 model both small and medium but the results in terms
of medium were quite remarkable, Yolov5 is the most powerful
objection detection algorithm at present, to better apply it in
the actual environment, especially in the supervision of COTS.
